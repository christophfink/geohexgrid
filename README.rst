Geohex
******
A Python 3.9+ library for casting evil spells upon the Earth.
Just kidding!
Humanity has already taken care of that.

Rather, a Python 3.9+ library for making geographic hexagon grids like those produced by QGIS's `create grid function <https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorcreation.html?highlight=create%20grid#create-grid>`_.
Not designed for making `discrete global grid systems <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_global_grid>`_.
